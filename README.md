# MIT App Inventor Extensions
This repository contains extensions for MIT App Inventor, including source code and `.aix` files. See [this documentation](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/other/extensions.html) for more information about App Inventor Extensions. See [this repository](https://github.com/jessvb/Example_App_Inventor_Extension) for more information about how to make your own App Inventor extension from the sources.

See the `example_apps` directory for Android applications (`.apk` and `.aia` files) using these extensions.

Note that the `Text Mixer` and `Sentence Generator` extensions both make HTTP requests to servers containing LSTMs. The servers' code can be found in the [What's up Dr. Seuss](https://github.com/heyyjudes/whats-up-dr-seuss) and [LSTM Web Server](https://github.com/jessvb/lstm_web_server) repositories.
