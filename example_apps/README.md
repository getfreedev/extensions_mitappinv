# Example Apps using the Extensions
In this directory there are a number of example Android applications that use the MIT App Inventor extensions found in this repository. The MIT App Inventor source files (`.aia` files) can be found in the `source_aia` folder, and the Android `apk` application files can be found in the `app_apk` folder.

## Duet Generator
This app uses the TextMixer extension to create songs alongside the user.

## Test PID Controller
This app uses the PID Controller extension to control a LEGO EV3 robot and a simulated elevator. The proportional, integral, and derivative gains (`Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd`) can be tuned using the `set PIDController.<gain>` blocks. There is also a screen where you can see the output of the controller, given particular gains. Tune, simulate, and play with as you like!
